# Problem #814 ([Binary Tree Pruning](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-pruning/) | Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Tree)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the same tree where every subtree (of the given tree)* not containing a `1` *has been removed*.

A subtree of a node `node` is `node` plus every node that is a descendant of `node`.
