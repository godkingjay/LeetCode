    +Check if the input integer n is equal to 1. If it is, return true since 1 is a power of four.
    +If n is non-positive (less than or equal to 0), return false since powers of four are positive integers.
    +Calculate the logarithm of 'n' with a base of 4 and store the result in the variable 'logarithmBase4.'
    +Check if 'logarithmBase4' is an integer by comparing it to its integer cast. If they are equal, return true; otherwise, return false.

Complexity

--Time complexity: O(1)O(1)O(1)
  Since we are only doing math operations without any loops or recursion.
--Space complexity: O(1)O(1)O(1)
  Since we are only storing constant variables.
