# Problem #1 ([Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum))

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`_.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

***

### Example 1
**Input:** `nums = [2,7,11,15]`, `target = 9` <br/>
**Output:** `[0,1]` <br/>
**Explanation:** Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we `return [0, 1]`.
