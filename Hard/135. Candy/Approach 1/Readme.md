    Greedy Algorithm: Two-Pass Method
    This method takes two passes through the ratings array to ensure that each child gets the appropriate amount of candy.

    One-Pass Greedy Algorithm: Up-Down-Peak Method
    This more advanced method uses a single pass and employs three key variables—Up, Down, and Peak—to efficiently determine the minimum number of candies needed.
