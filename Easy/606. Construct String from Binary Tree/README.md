# Problem #606 ([Construct String from Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree/) | Binary Tree, Depth-First Search, String, Tree)

Given the `root` of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it.

Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.
