# Problem #36 ([Valid Sudoko](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-sudoku/submissions/) | Array, Hash Table, Matrix)

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is *valid*. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

    - Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    - Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    - Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

**Note:**

    - A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
    - Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.
